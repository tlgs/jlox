# jlox

This is a _code along_ to Bob Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
It follows the first half of the book where we build a Java **tree-walk interpreter**.

I don't know Java.

## Usage

I'm using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) as a build tool
because I also don't know Make.

- build with `ninja -v`
- run with `./jlox [script]`
